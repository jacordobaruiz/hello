Please excuse the watermark as this is technically still a work in progress -I'm not married to a final design yet. This is something I really wanted to do  decided to work on it yesterday. Everything you see has been hand-drawn from scratch by myself; no copying, no tracing, just drawing. Colour palette has also been chosen by me, that's why it doesn't match Enter The Gungeon's. Colours are slightly artifacted due to the fact that the original design is quite, quite small. I upscaled the final product before your eyes however the final version will be much more polished... no artficats (hopefully).

This is the first proper pixel art project I've done in years and I like it.
